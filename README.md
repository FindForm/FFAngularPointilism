Angular Pointilism
==========

You may dive right in with the included [demo](https://github.com/FindForm/FFAngularPointilism/archive/master.zip); simply open the .xcodeproj and run on a 4" display

### Feature set is twofold 

#####1. Animatable iOS mosaic-like image filter #####

Note: Currently this library only supports XIB instantiation and has no exposed property for changing triangle size. (Would love to see a PR adding such functionality)
